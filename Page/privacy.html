     <br>
     <p>PGKNT swears to not collect or ask for Personal Data without consent unless required or needed to. Any website owned by us
          will not ask any type of information, and if information is somehow put, it does not collect it. A particular feature in

     <h3>Use of Analytics<h3>
          <br>
          <p>PGKNT may use a Third Party but Privacy Friendly Analytics service to further improve and maintain the websites we own,
               and to monitor the usage of those websites. Nevertheless the analytics will not collect personal data, and will not track 
               or monitor your browsing habits. All data from the Analytics services will be Anonymous Data only.
               <br style="line-height: 1.6px;"> 
          <h3>Cookies and other Site Tools</h3>
          <br>
          <p>PGKNT will not use any type of cookies or tools like ads and trackers on all of our owned websites. When we use third party services,
          we may not ensure what tools are used in those services as we do not own them. Our YouTube channel will not include ads but use alternative
          ways to gain some profit out of making Digital Safety videos.</p>
          <br style="line-height: 1.6px;"> 
          <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

          firstly before collecting non-identifiable/may be personal data. We also remind that our Videos are not for children as the topics may be not 
          suitable for their ages.</p>
          <br style="line-height: 1.6px;"> 
          <h3>Security of your Data<h3>
               <br>
               <p>PGKNT ensures that your Data is 100% secure on all electronic storage or on third party storage (if the data is input on a third party we use).
